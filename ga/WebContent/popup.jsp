			Gerrymandering is a serious issue obstructing the representation of
			American citizens in Congress. Congressional districts are normally
			redrawn every 10 years, often by the Congressmen whose positions
			depend on election results in those same districts. This has led to
			extreme cases of stretching and twisting district boundaries to
			produce rigged election results for those in power. <br> <br>
			This process is called Gerrymandering, named after Massachusetts
			Governor Elbridge Gerry when he drew a district shaped like a
			salamander to help his party win the upcoming 1812 state senate
			election. <br> <br> The Gerrymandering Analysis (GA)
			website serves as a tool for politicians and judges who wish to
			understand the scale of the problem, where it is most severe, and
			what can be done about it. <br> In addition to the visible
			components of the website, the GA server hosts access to multifaceted
			data about US states and Congressional districts over many election
			cycles. The GA service is still in its early stages of development,
			so if there are specific data, formats, or features you would like to
			see, feel free to let me know. <br> <br> &mdash; Benito
