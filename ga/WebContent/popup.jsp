			Gerrymandering is a serious issue obstructing the 
			representation of American citizens in Congress. Congressional
			districts are normally redrawn every 10 years, often by the
			Congressmen whose positions depend on election results in those same
			districts. This has led to extreme cases of stretching and twisting
			district boundaries to produce rigged election results for those in
			power. <br> <br> This process is called Gerrymandering,
			named after Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry when he drew a
			district shaped like a salamander to help his party win the upcoming
			1812 state senate election. <br> <br> The Gerrymandering
			Analysis (GA) website serves as a tool for politicians and judges who
			wish to understand the scale of the problem, where it is most severe,
			and what can be done about it. <br> In addition to the visible
			components of the website, the GA server hosts access to multifaceted
			data about US states and Congressional districts over many election
			cycles. The GA service is still in its early stages of development,
			so if there are specific data, formats, or features you would like to
			see, feel free to let me know. <br> <br> &mdash; Benito
